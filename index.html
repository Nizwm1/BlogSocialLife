            A person’s social life consists of the various bonds they form with
            others, such as family, friends, members of their community, and
            strangers. It can be measured by the duration and quality of the
            social interactions they have on a regular basis, both in person and
            online.

          <h2>Social animal</h2>
          <p class="section-pg">
            Human beings are social animals, and the tenor of someone's social
            life is one of the most important influences on their mental and
            physical health. Without positive, durable relationships, both minds
            and bodies can fall apart. Individuals begin life dependent for
            survival on the quality of their relationship with their primary
            caregiver, usually their mother.
          </p>

          <p class="section-pg">
            Humanity's survival as a species similarly hinges on the capacity
            for social living. Most of human history was spent in small groups
            in which each individual was dependent on others for survival;
            evidence suggests this is the condition to which humans are best
            adapted. Technology has changed the ways people interact with others
            in their daily lives, but it hasn’t affected the basic need to form
            supportive bonds with other people.

          <h2>Connection</h2>
          <p class="section-pg">
            Understanding how to establish and maintain supportive connections
            in any medium is an essential part of life. People who live alone
            especially benefit from cultivating a strong network of social
            connections. People have the freedom today to build their particular
            social cohort both online and offline; their social circles may
            include family, friends, professional mentors, and other important
            individuals in their lives.
          </p>
          <p class="section-pg">
            Online social ties can be a powerful source of social support and
            joy, especially for people who are isolated for geographical or
            other reasons. There is, however, no substitute for face-to-face
            interaction, and those who spend time among friends and family
            report higher levels of well-being than individuals with fewer ties
            "in real life."
