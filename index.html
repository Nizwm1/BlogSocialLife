            A person’s social life consists of the various bonds they form with
            others, such as family, friends, members of their community, and
            strangers. It can be measured by the duration and quality of the
            social interactions they have on a regular basis, both in person and
            online.

          <p class="section-pg">
            Human beings are social animals, and the tenor of someone's social
            life is one of the most important influences on their mental and
            physical health. Without positive, durable relationships, both minds
            and bodies can fall apart. Individuals begin life dependent for
            survival on the quality of their relationship with their primary
            caregiver, usually their mother.
          </p>

          <p class="section-pg">
            Humanity's survival as a species similarly hinges on the capacity
            for social living. Most of human history was spent in small groups
            in which each individual was dependent on others for survival;
            evidence suggests this is the condition to which humans are best
            adapted. Technology has changed the ways people interact with others
            in their daily lives, but it hasn’t affected the basic need to form
            supportive bonds with other people.
